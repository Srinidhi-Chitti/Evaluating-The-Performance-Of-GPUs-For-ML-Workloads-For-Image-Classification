# Evaluating-The-Performance-Of-GPUs-For-ML-Workloads-For-Image-Classification
We are evaluating different machine-learning models for image classification by running them on GPUs. The goal is to identify performance bottlenecks, measure how GPU architecture affects training and results, record them and maybe optimize the workflows for real-world industrial use.
